 this is mohamad code, 50% ready feautre.

 1.  pull latest from remote and apply local commits(unpushed) on top of the latest pull,  =============> 1. Git pull -rebase origin >>(auto stash).
 

 2. merge(wither we face conflict or not) this to local, and pull ======>2. git pull --no-rebase (auto merge)

 somtimes, merge conflicts fails to auto resolve, in this case, do git commit to resolve conflict in VIM(most likley)

 

 in both 1 and 2, changes are saved. and we may face conflicts in both
 

 note: any merge mean internally, 1. commit 2. you might face conflict and must resolve them. x  

 
this is my version of the code, /moahmmad //to be stashed
